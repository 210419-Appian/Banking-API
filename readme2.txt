Setup:
When setting up this application, it is important to first set up your
database. Outside of creating the database itself, bank_buiolder.sql
should do most of the rest of the work for you, including creating your
tables and setting up some dummy data. This can be run again if you need
to "reset" your database.
You should then edit ConnectionUtils.java with the relevant information
so that your program can connect to the database.It is found in the
com.bank.utils package.
